!TapirMail - 1.09 (05 Jan 2013)

TapirMail is a remote inbox POP3 email client. For more details about the
program, please visit the program's website at:

http://www.flypig.co.uk/tapirmail/

A manual, very generously created by Paul Stewart, is now available and
should have been supplied with your copy of TapirMail. It is also available
directly from the website above. In addition to this, interactive help is
also supported. Together these should hopefully provide sufficient
information for most users to navigate around the program.

Having said that, if you are having any problems with the program then please
email me at:

tapirmail@flypig.co.uk

Many of the icons used in this version of TapirMail are part of the Tango
